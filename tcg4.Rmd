## Data taken from 

We want to source NFL positional salaries to match the 
[538 article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/running-backs-are-finally-getting-paid-what-theyre-worth/).

We dont have access to NFL salaries from ESPN, so we have to find it manually at sportrac.

```{r}
url <- "https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/positional/2018/quarterback/"
read_html(url) %>% 
  html_nodes("table") %>% 
  html_table()
  
```
